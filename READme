## About
This repo is a paper simulator to test the live performance of machine learning binary classifiers for choosing when to buyand sell stocks, cryptocurrencies, and other tradeable assets. This simulator is connected to the Coinbase exchange, but in theory, can be applied to any exchange and any asset class. You can plug and play any machine learning binary classifier to see its performance
